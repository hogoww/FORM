CLisp program is used to transform prefixed first order logical proposition to their declaration for the Smalltalk program in the ../pharo/ directory.

The Clisp program is necessary to run the script.
You may have to chmod 111 propGenerator.lisp to be able to execute it.

A simple exemple would be:
(Or (P x) (P q))
which becomes:
Or new:
  (Predicate new:'P' fromList:
    (LinkedList new 
     add:(Term new:'x');
     yourself)
  )
 rightProp:
  (Predicate new:'P' fromList:
    (LinkedList new 
     add:(Term new:'q');
     yourself)
  )

It allows a more general syntax, and to generate directly into the target language implementation the object initialization, which is tedious to write by hand.

   	  ###  Usage ###

Put in the input file ("input.prop" by default) the proposition(s) that you wish to transform.
Then just run the script ./propGeneration.
The output will be displayed on the standart output,to be able to pipe it to another program (such as a clipboard one).

    	  ###  How to write a proposition  ###

The proposition are wrote in a prefixed lisp way.
/!\ Everything is case INsensitive.

#Predicates the predicates and terms
A predicate is also surrounded by parenthesis.
(P x)

The terms in a predicate can either be a simple term such as in the previous example or a Function term.
(P (f x))

A predicate can also be empty, but still needs the parenthesis wrapping it up
(P)

The terms of a Predicate/Function term are both variadic
(P (f x y z) z (g s r))


Note that in a proposition, the entities which are under an Operator or a Quantifier will be considered as Predicate, and the ones inside a Predicate will be considered as function terms (We can have this property since we're in first order logic and not in higher-order logic).

#Operators
So it's usually an operator followed by one or two predicates.
(And Predicate Predicate)
(Not Predicate)

The operators aren't variadic.

#Quantifier

In the same spirit:
(Exist terms Prop)
-The terms in the quantifiers are variadic.
(Exists x y z Prop)

-The terms can only be simple ones, no function will be recognize here.
So (Exists (f x) Prop) DOESN'T work.

   	  ####  Configuration  #####

The following things are configurable in the "configuration.lisp" file:

-The list of operator's symbols is modifiable, and variadic. /!\ The symbols are case INsensitive.
-The list of the operator's classes is modifiable without having to look in this tool's code.

Those lists aren't implemented yet for the constants.

-By default, the generated object is generated on several lines, with a correct indentation.
A compact mode is also available ("compact-mode" in the indent section).

-The appearence of the indent is modifiable through the "indent-string" property, in the indent section.
